# Introduction

The [https://www.netlifycms.org](NetlifyCMS) looks really cool. Hope this works!

# Goal

Ideally, we'll end up with a page that is editable by non-git users via Netlify's point-and-click interface.

# Testing a change again

## Tweeks

Changed this by making sure the GitHub repo has the same name as the Netlify page and adding ```/admin``` to the Netlify page (the GitHub page says authorized but doesn't lead to this page for editing).

Also changed the runs on code in .github/workflows/render-markdown.yml

```    
runs-on: ${{ matrix.config.os }}
    name: ${{ matrix.config.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        config:
          - os: windows-latest
          - os: macOS-latest
          - os: ubuntu-16.04
```
# Code

Here's some random `R` code in a block.

```
library(dplyr)

starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Droid")
```

# New from Netlify

Hi!!!
